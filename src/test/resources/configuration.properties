#if for any reason you made a mistake and put "Chrome" instead of "chrome" we will have an error but in the (Driver)
#class if anything was wrong it will execute the default part which is we put there ChromeDriver
#or the other way we could convert the word to lower case, go to (Driver) class and see it there
#browserType = chrome

#if you work on a server you will not have any UI so you won't be able to watch anything in this case we need to run
#the browser on headless, so headless means running the browser without seeing it, so if we put the driver on
#headless mode and execute the scenario we will see the console but we will not see the browser opening and closing
#like what we used to see

#to use the browser with the headless mode
browserType = chrome-headless
#browserType = firefox-headless

#to use the browser without the headless mode
#browserType = firefox
#browserType = chrome
