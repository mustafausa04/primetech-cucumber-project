public class Hooks {
    //Hooks in Cucumber-Java are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. (Similar to TestNG â€“
    // Before/After annotations
    //They allow you to set up and tear down the test environment, such as opening and closing browsers,
    //initializing test data, or logging test execution.
    //Hooks can be useful for reducing code duplication and managing the test execution flow.
    //There are several annotations used to define hooks in Cucumber-Java:
    // @Before: This annotation is used to run a block of code before each scenario. It is typically used for
    // setup tasks.
    // @After: This annotation is used to run a block of code after each scenario. It is typically used for
    // cleanup tasks.
    // @BeforeStep: This annotation is used to run a block of code before each step in a scenario. It can be
    // useful for setting up specific conditions before each step.
    // @AfterStep: This annotation is used to run a block of code after each step in a scenario. It can be
    // useful for performing actions after each step, such as ta

    //we can add anything before the scenario using @Before annotation, also we can add (order) next to it to make
    //it run first or second if we decide to split them like below look at the example at the end of the page. we
    //can also add (@smoke) which means before you run the scenario add those steps (maximize, implicitly) with
    //exception only if that scenario has @smoke annotation on it, so basically run those steps(maximize, implicitly)
    //before any scenario has @smoke, if the scenario doesn't have @smoke will still be run but without those steps
    //(maximize, and implicitly)
    //("not @demo") this means do not run those Before steps for anything has demo tag and api tag
    @Before("not @demo and not @api") //("@smoke") //make sure you import this from io.cucumber.java
