    //The (singleton pattern) in software engineering is a design pattern that
    //restricts the instantiation of a class to one object only. which means we create a driver and we force to use it
    //by it self not any other driver that's it's called (singleton pattern)
    //What if we keep instantiating new driver for every test ?
    //When you run a suite of tests, it creates multiple browser windows which can cause:
    //1.Increased overhead (resource usage).
    //2.Risk of one test interfering with another due to shared resources or race conditions.a.This type of issue can
    //occur especially when you want to run test in parallel in the future
    //3.Tests failing due to session timeouts or browser performance issues.
    //basically we will instantiate one driver for all sessions or all test cases in this case we don't have to create
    //a driver for each session or each test case imagine if we have 1000 test case and we do regression then we will
    //have all these drivers run at the same time and it will be conflict between them

    //is ChromeDriver and start the session and then return it to use it (we have to return it because we put the return
